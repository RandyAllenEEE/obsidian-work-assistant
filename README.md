## 🚀 Overview

**Work Assistant** is a substantial evolution and merger of several powerful community plugins. It is designed to be the central hub for your time-based knowledge management.

By combining the visual navigation of a **Calendar**, the powerful configuration of **Periodic Notes**, and the motivation of **Word Count Heatmaps**, this plugin offers a seamless workflow for journalling, planning, and reviewing.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📅 Unified Calendar View
Navigate your personal timeline with ease. The calendar view sits in your sidebar, allowing you to instantly jump to any Daily Note.
- **Visual Navigation**: Click any date to open or create that day's note.
- **Event Indicators**: See at a glance which days have notes, tasks, or significant writing activity.

### 🔁 Periodic Notes Powerhouse
Manage all your time-based notes in one place. No longer do you need separate plugins for different granularities.
- **Full Spectrum Support**: **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, **Quarterly**, and **Yearly** notes.
- **Granular Configuration**: customize formatting, templates, and folders for each time period independently.
- **Smart Navigation**: Easily jump between adjacent time periods (e.g., Next Week, Previous Month).

### 🔥 Productivity Heatmap
Turn your calendar into a productivity tracker.
- **Word Count Visualization**: The background intensity of each day on the calendar reflects your writing volume.
- **Goal Tracking**: Visualize your consistency and "streaks" directly on your calendar.
- **Customizable**: Define your own word count thresholds and color intensities to match your workflow.

## 🛠️ Configuration

The plugin features a simplified, flat configuration structure for ease of use:

1.  **Periodic Settings**: Go to `Settings > Work Assistant` to enable and configure each note type (Day, Week, Month, Quarter, Year) individually.
2.  **Appearance**: Customize the calendar's "Start of Week", week number display, and locale settings.
3.  **Heatmap**: Adjust "Words per Dot" and color ranges to calibrate the visual feedback for your writing habits.
